        I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for
        this sort of thing. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I can't get
        involved! I've got work to do!
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't believe in the Force, do you? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
        Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
        Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? He is here. I
        suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self
        and act on instinct. What?!

        Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
        Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Don't act
        so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
